# Sofle V2

This is the repository containing my [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/) configurations for the [Sofle V2 Keyboard](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/).

I am using the [Keymap Editor](https://www.google.com/search?q=nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to facilitate the configuration and firmware build.

To download the latest artifact generated from the firmware build, go [here](https://github.com/matheusdcunha/keymap-config/actions).
